## TODO
- projectile rewrite
	- projectiles are created by passing a cardinal direction and a coordinate
	- it should be a velocity vector and a coordinate value
- drawOrder fix
	- the drawOrder table is global and cannot be recreated when moving to new maps
	- must be completed before doorways can be done
